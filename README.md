# Installation
Eventually I will make an aur package, but right now you need to do it manually.
first run ```git clone https://github.com/Jadonus/faur.git``` to clone this repo.
Then ``` pip install pkgbuilder``` (with python-pip installed) to get the dependency for this.
Finally, for a shortterm use of this, run ```python3 faur``` to run Faur!
If you with to run it without when not in that directory or when not using python3 before it, add it to your path by running```chmod +x faur``` then, ```cp faur ~/.local/bin/```
You now have Faur installed. YAY! Wait not yay. Faur!

# Usage

Running ```faur -h``` will give you a list of arguments. Overall it uses similar arguments to pacman, -Syu, -S etc.
